    ZetaFence Attack Path Analysis

## Underlying Motivations

ZetaFence platform monitors security risks from their roots by mapping attack landscapes and meticulously backtracking through users, identities, policies, their activities, attempting to expose hidden connections that lead to breaches. As described in dependency sections, ensuing power of the platform is a result of encapsulating complex relationships using Hypergraphs, enriching graph elements, and constructing relationships that form the Hypergraphs.
